## Guest

Guest is a web guestbook created with Meteor. Any user may leave their name and a comment. The comments are displayed according to timestamp, with the newest on top. A login feature  is available for administrators, who have the ability to edit or delete the names and comments left by users. 

## Notes

The insecure package has not yet been removed from the project. I was unsure about how to make the events associated with updates to mongo entries compatible with Meteor ‘methods’.
